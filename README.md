# Tube_Synth

A 5U vacuum tube modular synth.
What a strange idea... ^^

1 - the context : 

I met up again with a friend who will soon be retired and who has been a tube amp enthusiast for a very long time.
He repairs them, makes them, modifies them and so on.


Now we see each other from time to time, we chat, he comes to my home studio, I go to his place, we chat, we have a laugh, we exchange components and tips.


And then, one day he says to me: "How would you like to make a tube modular" :o
... uh yes ... I say to him with a drop of sweat starting to bead on my forehead :D


I dream about it at night now ^^


2 - Format

We decided to go for 5U - DotCom, as we're going to be using lamps requiring a high power supply (up to 150V), so we'd be stuck with 3U Euro skiff friendly ;)


And so the 6.35mm jacks of circumstance.
The size of the box will be 12U wide, i.e. 648mm
I'd like to put 2 rows of 5U high and 3 rows of 1U high for utilities that will work without tubes.

3 - Power Supply 

There will be 3 differents voltage at least :
* 150V DC
* 6.3V AC
* +/-15V

We'll be using terminal strips for the lamps, making direct connections between tubes and components, not PCBs, but wire on the fly from component to component.

There will still be some pcb's for utility modules that are not tube base, such as multiple.


4 - Front Panel

We'll experiment with dibond, then use a CNC to engrave the final faces on aluminium.


5 - Modules

Tubes :
AUX IN - VCA Metasonix

POWER x 1
S/H + Seq


6 - CaseS, Yes, this project requires 2 cases

* One for the power supply
* One for the synth
